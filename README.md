## Description

While there exists a number of great tools for generating palettes for website themes sometimes you just need a bunch of colors to use in pie charts that aren't going to look entirely awful and are visually distinct from each other. Huey is a small tool that will generate a 7 color rainbow list that match the saturation and lightness of a given key color.
